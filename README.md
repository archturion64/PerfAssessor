# PerfAssessor
A C# benchmarking tool for testing containers and routines.

	This code is by no means readable since that was not my aim whilst writing it.
	I wanted to see how far could I be able to push the functional programming envelope in C#.
	In the process I wanted to explore some of C#'s more used containers and their performance
